### Questions:
\
    __- What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?__\
    The topic I found the most interesting are all the nuances related to EV charging infrastructure, such as how the grid supplies power, how government regulations and legislation affects the construction and expansion of infrastructure, as well as the geographical investigation of infrastructure locations in regards to demographics.\ 
\
\
    __- Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.__\
    A potential investigation I'd like to pursue is a way to measure the accessability of ev chargers throughout San Diego, as well as a metric to identify correlated demographics, such as local racial proportions, income disparities, or age stratifications.\
\
\
    __- What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?__\
    A potential change I'd consider would be giving more concrete or complex goals for the exploration and discovery of tools we learned to use, such as OSMnx and Cenpy. There were very simple goals given to us, but I usually prefer structured guidance. However, I think that the format of the explorations was still extremely useful, and contacting my mentors was also more than sufficient to expand my understanding.
\
\
    __- What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?__\
    A I'd be interested in using are some basic modeling techniques on the data we've explored.
